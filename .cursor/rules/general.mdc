Code Rules:

## Self-documenting coding style:

- **Clear Naming:**
    Use descriptive variable, function, and class names that clearly indicate their purpose.
- **Structured Code:**
    Employ organised code with logical blocks and consistent indentation to improve readability.
- **Expressive Code:**
    Write code that is straightforward and easy to follow, minimizing the need for extra explanations.
- **Comments as Needed:**
    While the goal is to minimise comments, use them sparingly to clarify complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or the why behind the code. Balance is key
